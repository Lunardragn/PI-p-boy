# NOTE:
This is currently untested, as I am still working on obtaining parts. 

Updates will be made after I get the components

# Dependencies:
### pyautogui
### RPi.GPIO

# TO DO:

### Implement a custom GUI, to select from a list of apps.
### GPS compatibility via UBLOX-7 module.
### "Graceful" Desktop interaction (Onscreen keyboard, etc).
### KDE Connect stuff, make it like a smart watch.
### Modular GPIO, allowing for custom modules to be slapped into it and interacted with (I.E: Thermometer, laser distance sensor, MQ series gas sensors).
### A way for the PI to figure out what its connected to. Could be temporarily solved with a dropdown menu to select what's installed, though that seems cumbersome
### Proper setup guide.
### Custom assets (Boot screen, buttons, fonts).
### Modded 3d printed case, to allow for a bigger battery, interfacing for custom modules, extra buttons (If needed, not sure how far the twin rotary encoders can go in terms of being "comfortable").
